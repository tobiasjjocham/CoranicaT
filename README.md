# CoranicaT
font development for near eastern scripts with special character for mss

This page is used to collect information about the "ingredients" for the Amiri-Fork, as well as the most recent build (due to problems with building process, I do not push from the build system back to the repository, and for now I am only working on the Amiri-Regular)

Furthermore, this will be the place where I will provide the collection of keyboard layout files created for the special use cases of typing early Qurʾānic MSS as well as helpful input methods for Oriental Studies in general.
